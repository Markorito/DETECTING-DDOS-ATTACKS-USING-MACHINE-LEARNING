# DETECTING DDOS ATTACKS USING MACHINE LEARNING
## BACKGROUND
 Final year project creating a simple classifier to detect DDOS attacks
This project is a simple project made using Scikit-Learn models deployed via Django and accessed via the REST API
It uses a combination of random forest classifiers and extra trees classifiers to classify whether networking packets are benign normal packets or a part of a botnet designed to carry out a DDOS attack
